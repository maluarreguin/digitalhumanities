Containing nearly 4,000 records during this period, the database is expansive and telling for its users to comprehend a firmer grasp on the happenings of this era. At length, this survey conveys much of the social and cultural history of Scotland and is an excellent example of the utilization of digital humanities tools and techniques in historical and academic fields. On the opening page of the survey, the introductory excerpt states, “You can use the database to conduct all sorts of searches. For instance, you can find all known cases involving neighborhood quarrels, or demonic possession, or fairies.” (Goodare, et al.). While there are many possible angles one could utilize that stem from this database, for the sake of this argument, we will be taking a deeper look into the presence of fairies in Scottish witchcraft.</p><p>Originating from Scottish folklore, many stories and legends were rich in incorporating the presence of fairies into their corpus. According to legend, fairies were believed to be supernatural beings who lived in a parallel world that was closely linked to our own. They were known to be mischievous, sometimes benevolent, but also capable of causing harm if they were angered. Further, according to Henderson and Cowan, fairies were “[…] as real to people as the sunrise, and as incontrovertible as the existence of God," in the medieval and early modern eras (Henderson). One of the most famous Scottish fairy tales from this period is the story of Tam Lin, who according to the legend, was a young man who was kidnapped by the fairy queen while riding through the woods. Supposedly the queen intended to make him her lover, but Tam Lin was eventually rescued by a brave woman named Janet, who outsmarted the fairy queen and broke the curse that had been placed on Tam Lin. Another popular Scottish fairy tale from this era is the belief of the Brownie, or a specific type of fairy to the Scottish people. Brownies were regarded as benevolent fairies who were believed to help with household chores in exchange for small gifts from their patron families. They were often depicted as small, hairy creatures who lived in the shadows and came out at night to do their work (Henderson). In addition to these specific tales, Scottish folklore of this era was full of stories about encounters with fairies, both good and bad. People believed that fairies could appear in many different forms, from tiny, delicate creatures to tall, imposing beings. They were thought to have the power to grant wishes, but also to cause mischief and mayhem. At length, a fairies behavior seemed to be largely associated with their temperament than anything else (Brown).</p><p>Witchcraft became a crime in 1563 which is when this database begins, and its methodologies for accusations of accused witches corresponds with the early Protestants having been criticized by the medieval Church as superstitious, so popular religion and folk belief naturally fell under scrutiny (Barry, et al.). In Scottish folklore, witches were believed to have the power to communicate with fairies and enlist their help in casting spells and performing magical rituals. One example of this is the use of fairy ointment or "fairy salve" in Scottish witchcraft. This was a substance that witches believed would allow them to enter the world of fairies and travel great distances in a short amount of time. According to legend, the ointment was made from various ingredients, including herbs and the fat of unbaptized children, and was applied to the skin or taken internally. There were also stories of witches making pacts with fairies, where the fairies would grant them magical powers in exchange for something in return, such as their soul or their firstborn child. These pacts were often portrayed as dangerous, as the fairies were seen as unpredictable and capricious beings who could turn on the witch at any moment (Briggs). In some cases, fairies were even believed to be the cause of witchcraft accusations. The first record of fairies and witches comes from the trial of Bessie Dunlop, an Ayrshire woman who was convicted in 1576 and burned, probably on Castle Hill. Bessie was a healer who derived her power from the fairies. She claimed that the dead Thome Reid, who had gone to live with them, had first introduced her to the fairy queen. The 1588 trial record of Alesoun Pierson indicates she was burned for “hanting and repairing with the gude nychtbouris and Quene of Elfame” (haunting and communing with the ‘good neighbours’ and Queen of Elfland). She too had been introduced by a dead man living with the fairies, her uncle, William Sampson. Pearson claimed that the fairies had hit her for revealing their secrets, and the mark she bore was insensitive to pain, which was taken as proof by the authorities of her pact with the devil (MacCulloch, 234). Further, in the trial of Issobell Gowdie in 1662, the accused claimed to have made a pact with the Queen of the Fairies and to have attended a fairy court. Lastly, the complicated case of regarding John Stewart among others in 1697, details numerous accusations of murdering children through magical strangulation and possession, and characterizes the case amongst demonic possessions, maleficium, and fairies (Goodare, et al.). </p><p>Overall, while not all Scottish witchcraft during this period involved fairies, they were often a part of the folklore and mythology surrounding witchcraft and were ultimately seen as powerful beings who could be both allies and enemies of witches during this era. Further, this piece does not attempt to drive home an inherent argument but rather explore a specific charecteristic in the data at the large and theorize what these details could substantiate.  </p><p> </p><p class="align-center"> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/digitalhumanities/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/digitalhumanities/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
